Oh Rust, youâ€™re so smart,
With lifetimes tearing me apart.
No nulls, no race, no fun â€”
I miss C++â€¦ just kidding, I run.

I begged for a loop,
It gave me match, then said "Oops!"
Pattern match or die,
Else the compiler will cry.

The borrow checker
Acts like my clingy ex â€”
"Is that my reference?"
Yesâ€¦ I guess?

Threads are now safe, yay!
But I canâ€™t clone my own way.
Ownership is king,
But I own absolutely nothing.

Cargo builds it all,
While mocking me in debug.
"Try again, mortal,"
It chuckles with smug.

But deep in my soul,
I know itâ€™s all worth the pain â€”
Because when it runsâ€¦
It runs like a goddamn train. ðŸš‚
